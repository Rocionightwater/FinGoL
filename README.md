# FinGoL

FinGoL consists of an Educational Game Chatbot (Gamebot) on the subject of Personal Finances. The main purpose of this project is to educate young adults (you) to better understand, manage and control their personal finances.

## What will you find in FinGoL?

First of all, please notice that this is merely an Educational Financial Game and therefore you will be exposed to a fictitious environment. This is not yet real life, but it is preparing you for real financial life. 😃 
In order words, this is a safe and fun environment where you can ‘simulate’ a real job application, a real purchasing or renting of a house/car, among many other cool situations!

In FinGoL you can build your personal finances from scratch by, for example:
- Creating a profile 👤
- Creating your Curriculum Vitae 📝
- Searching for a job 👩🏻‍🌾👨🏻‍🍳👩🏻‍🔬👨🏻‍🎨👩🏻‍🚀👨🏻‍⚖️
- Managing your budget: income and expenses sources ⚖️💰
- Simulating how a mortgage works 🕵️
- Buying/Renting a cool house 🏡
- Buying your dream car 🚗🏎️
- Purchasing standard stocks (buy actions from cool and relevant companies) 📈📊
- Purchasing green stocks (be green and invest in renewable technology) 📈🌿
- Getting a house insurance 🏡🛡️
- Getting a car insurance (you know..., do not drive if you are not insured) 🚗🛡️
- Getting a health insurance (always protect yourself)🛡️
- Getting a loan (you may need some financial support) 💰

We also offer you interesting videos, e.g. ‘About this game’ and ‘How to play’ and ‘How to manage your budget’, that will help you to better know this game and personal finances.
